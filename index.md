# Timeline of Satellites
---
Welcome to a historical timeline of Humankind's exploratory satellites and their journey through our solar system. Because NASA catalogues over 300 man-made satellites in the Planetary Science mission category alone, this timeline focuses on first time achievements and major breakthroughs in space and planetary exploration missions. 

Because this is Github, this is a living timeline. Anyone can contribute corrections or additions using the [Branches](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#branch) and [Pull Requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr) features common to all Github collaborative projects. You can read the documentation about Branches and Pull Requests in the links I've just provided. Every entry in this list follows a simple [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) formula which can be utilized if you wish to make a contribution. The markdown template for each entry [looks like this](https://github.com/arh12879/Timeline-Man-Made-Satellites/blob/gh-pages/satelliteMarkdownExample).

I hope you find the timeline enjoyable and informative.

**Sputnik 1**

![Sputnik1](/images/sputnik1.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1957-10-04

**Launch Agency/Nation:** USSR

**Mass:** 83.6 kg    

Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite launched into orbit by humans. The Sputnik 1 satellite could measure atmospheric density, and internal and external temperatures, and was able to transmit this data back to Earth. A monumental achievement for the Soviet Union (both from a technological and a propaganda standpoint), the launch of Sputnik 1 kicked off what's known as the Space Race. The United States feared being left at a technological disadvantage if they did not make commensurate gains in spaceflight. NASA was formed just a year later to coordinate these efforts.

**Explorer 1**

![Explorer1](/images/explorer1.gif)

**Launch Date:** 1958-02-01    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** DoD/USA    

**Mass:** 13.97 kg    

Explorer 1 was the first American satellite launched into Earth orbit. The satellite could detect cosmic rays and transmit this data back to Earth. It was the first satellite to discover the Van Allen Radiation Belt that surrounds the Earth in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). The radiation in this region can be damaging to electronics, so satellites are rarely positioned here in comparison to Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

**Mariner 2**

![Mariner2](/images/mariner2.gif)

**Launch Date:** 1962-08-27    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** NASA/USA  

**Mass:** 202.8 kg    

Mariner 2 was the first satellite to fly by another planet in our solar system: our closest neighbor, Venus. The satellite was a backup copy of the Mariner 1, which was intentionally destroyed out of caution when the launch went awry. Mariner 2 was equipped with an array of electronics used to study the atmosphere and magnetosphere of Venus. During its flight from Earth, it was also used to study the space inbetween planets.

**Astérix**

![Asterix](/images/asterix.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1965-11-26    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** France  

**Mass:** 42 kg    

Astérix, also known as A-1, was the first satellite launched by a nation that was neither the USA nor the USSR. France became the third nation to launch an orbital satellite with Astérix. Unfortunately, the probe's telemetry equipment stopped working shortly after launch. Little to no data was transmitted home, which was intended to be diagnostic flight data, but the satellite did achieve orbit nonetheless.

**Ohsumi**

![Ohsumi](/images/Ohsumi.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1970-02-11    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** ISAS/Japan  

**Mass:** 24 kg    

Ohsumi, also known as Ōsumi, was the first satellite launched into orbit by the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science at the University of Tokyo. The probe had equipment to measure ionosphere, temperature, and solar emissions. This marked the fourth time an individual nation had achieved orbital space flight with a scientific instrument.

**Dong Fang Hong 1 (China 1)**

![DongFangHong1](/images/dfh1.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1970-04-24    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** China  

**Mass:** 173 kg    

Dong Fang Hong 1, known in the West as China 1 or PRC 1, was the People's Republic of China's first orbital satellite. The satellite used radio transmitters to broadcast the current time, and also to broadcast the song "Dong Fang Hong". The song contained lyrics praising the Chinese Communist Party and their leader, Mao Zedong. This made China the fifth nation in space.

**Mariner 9**

![Mariner9](/images/mariner9.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1971-05-30    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** NASA/USA  

**Mass:** 558.8 kg    

Mariner 9 was the first spacecraft to orbit a planet in our solar system, the red planet Mars. Mariner 9 was equipped with technology to map the topology of Mars, measure its atmosphere, and even photograph its surface. Mariner 9 was able to map very nearly the entire surface of Mars during its orbital mission. Its mission ended, Mariner 9 shut down in the 1970s still in Martian orbit. It is expected to enter the Martian atmosphere in 2022.

**Prospero 1**

![Prospero1](/images/prospero1.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1971-10-28    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** United Kingdom  

**Mass:** 65.77 kg    

Prospero 1, also known as X-3 or Black Arrow, is the United Kingdom's first satellite placed into orbit. Prospero was launched to test orbital communications equipment. It also tested the incidence of micrometeoroids. Despite its short mission length, the satellite remained in communication for decades and is still in orbit today.

**Pioneer 10**

![Pioneer10](/images/pioneer10.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1972-03-03    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** NASA/USA  

**Mass:** 258 kg    

The first satellite ever sent to explore Jupiter, and the first satellite to ever attain a course that would take it out of heliocentric orbit, leaving our solar system behind.

**Pioneer 11**

![Pioneer11](/images/pioneer11.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1973-04-06    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** NASA/USA  

**Mass:** 259 kg    

Like Pioneer 10 before it, Pioneer 11 also investigated Jupiter. However, it also became the first probe to explore the ringed planet Saturn. Pioneers 10 and 11, due to both being planned with an escape trajectory from the solar system, each carried a special plaque as a hopeful greeting in the event they may ever be found by distant civilizations. The plagues are made of gold-anodized aluminum to protect them for spending eternity drifting through space. The plaques bear an engraving that attempts to portray what its human creators look like, a representation of a Hydrogen atom, and a galactic map to try and describe the probes place of origin.

**Mariner 10**

![Mariner10](/images/mariner10.gif)

**Launch Date:** 1973-11-03    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** NASA/USA  

**Mass:** 473.9 kg    

Mariner 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Mercury, our smallest planet. It pioneered the use of gravitational assists, whereby a satellite uses the gravitational force of a planet to accelerate it off towards its intended destination planet. Mariner 10 provided not only the first close-up shots of Mercury, but of Venus as well.

**Venera 9**

![Venera9](/images/venera10.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1975-06-08    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** USSR  

**Mass:** 2300 kg    

The Soviet spacecraft Venera 9 achieved dual firsts: it was the first satellite to orbit Venus, and it deposited a lander (also designated Venera 9) that was the first spacecraft to return photos from the surface of another planet. The lander mission lasted a total of 53 minutes before it lost contact with the orbiter, either due to the orbiter moving out of range, or the lander succumbing to the crushing density and caustic atmosphere of the Venusian surface.

**Voyager 2**

![Voyager2](/images/voyager2.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1977-08-20    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** NASA/USA  

**Mass:** 721.9 kg    

The Voyager spacecrafts were both charged with exploring the furthest planets of our solar system. Voyager 2 flew by its primary targets, the planets Jupiter and Saturn, and took tens of thousands of images. The probe later continued on to its secondary targets of Uranus and Neptune. Voyager 2 holds the distinction of being the only probe in history to have explored Uranus, the only probe to have explored Neptune, and the only probe to have explored all four of our solar system's giant planets. It is still performing measurements and transmitting data home to this day, nearly 50 years from launch.

**Voyager 1**

![Voyager1](/images/voyager1.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1977-09-05    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** NASA/USA  

**Mass:** 721.9 kg    

Voyager 1 holds the distinction of being the farthest-traveled and fastest-moving human-made object in history. It has overtaken Pioneer 10 in distance, despite launching five years later. Like Voyager 2, Voyager 1 also made fly bys of Jupiter and Saturn. Both of the Voyager space probes bear an identical gold-plated phonograph record. The record contains both images and sounds of Earth, including such things as images of human portraits, food, architecture, insects, animals, and more. The recording bears sounds such as bird song, whale song, the sounds of waves and thunder, human greetings in 55 languages, laughter, music, and more.

 **New Horizons**

![NewHorizons](/images/new_horizons.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 2006-01-19    

**Launch Agency/Nation:** NASA/USA  

**Mass:** 385 kg    

New Horizons is the first probe designed specifically to fly by Pluto and its moon Charon. The probe provided our first high resolution images of Pluto when it arrived in July 2015, over nine years after its launch from Earth. New Horizons is the only probe ever designed with such a long-distance primary mission, and its speed and trajectory now make it the fifth human-made satellite en route to leave our solar system. It is the only one that is not carrying a symbolic plaque.
