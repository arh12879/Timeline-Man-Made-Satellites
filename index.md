# Timeline of Satellites
---
Welcome to a historical timeline of Humankind's exploratory satellites and their journey through our solar system. Because NASA catalogues over 300 man-made satellites in the Planetary Science mission category alone, this timeline focuses on first time achievements and major breakthroughs in space and planetary exploration missions. 

Because this is Github, this is a living timeline. Anyone can contribute corrections or additions using the [Branches](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#branch) and [Pull Requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr) features common to all Github collaborative projects. You can read the documentation about Branches and Pull Requests in the links I've just provided. Every entry in this list follows a simple [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) formula which can be utilized if you wish to make a contribution. The markdown template for each entry [looks like this](https://github.com/arh12879/Timeline-Man-Made-Satellites/blob/gh-pages/satelliteMarkdownExample).

I hope you find the timeline enjoyable and informative.

**Sputnik 1**

![Sputnik1](/images/sputnik1.jpg)

**Launch Date:** 1957-10-04

**Launch Agency/Nation:** USSR

**Mass:** 83.6 kg    

Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite launched into orbit by humans. A monumental achievement for the Soviet Union (both from a technological and a propaganda standpoint), the launch of Sputnik 1 kicked off what's known as the Space Race. The United States feared being left at a technological disadvantage if they did not make commensurate gains in spaceflight. NASA was formed just a year later to coordinate these efforts.
